# 3D File Viewer

The **3D File Viewer** is a web-based application that allows users to preview 3D objects by uploading `.glb` files. This tool offers a smooth and interactive interface, enabling users to rotate, zoom, and capture screenshots or GIFs of their 3D models. It also supports various 3D file formats, making it versatile for different project needs.

## Features

- **3D Model Preview**:  
  Users can upload `.glb` and other supported 3D file formats and interactively view their 3D models in the browser. The model can be rotated 360 degrees, zoomed in and out, and viewed from different angles.

- **Lighting Setup**:  
  The viewer provides proper lighting for the front view of the 3D object, ensuring the model is always clearly visible, even when rotated.

- **Screenshot Capture**:  
  After uploading a file, users can take screenshots of their 3D models at any angle. The screenshot feature is easily accessible once a model is uploaded.

- **GIF Creation**:  
  The app offers a GIF capture function, allowing users to create revolving GIFs of their 3D models. The object revolves smoothly without any cuts, creating a seamless loop.

- **Intuitive UI**:  
  The interface is designed for simplicity and ease of use. After a file is uploaded, the file upload button disappears, and new buttons such as "View New Object" and "Capture" options (for screenshots and GIFs) appear, streamlining the user experience.

- **File Format Support**:  
  In addition to `.glb` files, the viewer supports other common 3D file formats, making it a flexible tool for various 3D model visualizations.

- **Dynamic File Management**:  
  After uploading a model, users can view a new object by clicking the "View New Object" button, which resets the viewer to allow for a fresh file upload.

## Tasks for Contributors

We welcome contributors to enhance the project! Here are a few tasks you can work on:

1. **Improved Lighting Controls**:  
   Add more dynamic lighting options, such as multiple light sources or user-adjustable light intensity, to improve model visibility from various angles.

2. **Expanded GIF Animation**:  
   Add customizable GIF creation options like speed adjustments, starting and stopping points, and looping options for better animation control.

3. **Additional 3D Format Support**:  
   Extend support to other 3D formats such as `.fbx`, `.obj`, and `.stl`. Ensure compatibility with the current viewing and interaction mechanisms.

4. **UI Enhancements**:  
   Improve the UI design with better styling, including layout improvements, mobile responsiveness, and animations for a smoother user experience.

5. **Error Handling**:  
   Implement better error handling for unsupported file uploads, invalid formats, and loading issues to provide feedback to users.

6. **Camera Controls**:  
   Add more refined camera control options, such as orbit, zoom sensitivity, and reset camera position, to enhance the user experience when interacting with models.

7. **Performance Optimization**:  
   Optimize the loading and rendering of 3D objects, especially for large files, to reduce lag and improve performance.
